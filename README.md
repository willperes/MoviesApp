## Folder Structure

```
â”œâ”€â”€ Domain                # Domain layer containing folders for models (entities) and scenes
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ (DomainName)        
â”‚       â”œâ”€â”€ Models        # Entities specific to that domain
â”‚       â””â”€â”€ Scenes        # Scenes for that domain containing View Controler, Interactor, Presenter, Worker and Router
â”‚           â”œâ”€â”€ (DomainName)ViewController
â”‚           â”œâ”€â”€ (DomainName)Interactor
